## Synopsis

The three chili special is really hot, is it?  Says who?

The [Scoville Scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scoville_scale) is an objective scale that measures the heat of spiciness in foods.  My exploring a user's taste profile with respect to foods with known Scoville Ratings, it is possible to identify what range of spiciness they find effective and tolerable.  Once a person's spiciness profile is known, their subjective ratings can be mapped to an estimated Scoville rating based on past experience

## Motivation

When someone says a dish is "super hot", make an educated guess on the Scoville rating based on other foods they would call "super hot"
